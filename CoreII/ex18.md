```java
public class Ex18 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(triangleDescription("Bob", 53, 23));
    System.out.println(triangleDescription("Fred", 3, 12));
    System.out.println(triangleDescription("Sarah", 17, 99));
  }

  public static int findTriangleArea(int base, int height) {
    return 0.5 * base * height;
  }

  public static String triangleDescription(String name, int base, int height) {
    return "Triangle, " + name + ", has a base of " + base + " m" +
    ", a height of " + height + " m and an area of " + findTriangleArea(base, height) +
    "m^2";
  }
}
```

### Explanation
1. In this exercise, we introduce methods that return values. `findTriangleArea(int base, int height)` returns an `int`, while `triangleDescription(String name, int base, int height)` returns `String`. You will notice that values are returned using the `return` keyword, which is followed by the value to be returned. You will also notice that methods can call other methods, as in line 14, where `triangleDescription` uses `findTriangleArea`.
2. Methods can have multiple `return` statements. However this doesn't mean that they will return multiple values, the method will stop once it reaches the first `return` statement. That means if you have a `return` statement in an `if` statement, and another `return` statement afterwards, then the method will stop at the first `return` statement, if the `if` statement runs, and at the second otherwise.
