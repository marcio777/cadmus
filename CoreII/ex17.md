### Explanation
In this exercise we create our own methods into our code. Methods as explained earlier, are blocks of codes that do one or more specific things and can be called. They can also take arguments as input. Methods are declared within a `public class` code block, as above. For now they will all begin with `public static`. Then will be their return type, i.e. the data type they return, if they return anything. If they don't return anything then there will just be `void`, meaning this method doesn't return anything. Then there will be parentheses, and inside the parentheses a list of arguments, that the method takes, delimited by commas. The arguments will be in the form a data type followed by the name, that the code inside the method will access it by. After the parentheses will be a code block, delimited by curly brackets.

As you've probably figured out that means `public static void main(String[] args)` is a method that doesn't return anything, and takes one argument in the form of a string array. That is correct. When you run your Java program, Java looks for the method with the **signature** `public static void main(String[] args)`, and that is the method that is initially run, and the method from which you can call other methods.
