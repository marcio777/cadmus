```java
public class Ex15 {
  // Longs are a way of representing big numbers
  // Longs use 64 bits (8 bytes)
  long myLong = 43344334343434;
  // Where as integers use 32 bits (4 bytes)
  int myInt = 444444444;
  // However shorts are a way of representing small numbers
  // They are useful when you lack memory
  // Shorts only take up 16 bits (2 bytes)
  short myShort = 1444;
  // Even smaller, than shorts however are bytes
  // Bytes takes up 8 bits, and you guessed it 1 byte
  byte myByte = 44;

  // All can store only whole numbers

  System.out.println("The biggest number you can store in a byte is " + Byte.MAX_VALUE);
  System.out.println("But the biggest number you can store in a short is " + Short.MAX_VALUE);
  System.out.println("But the biggest number you can store in an integer is " + Integer.MAX_VALUE);
  System.out.println("But the biggest number you can store in a long is " + Long.MAX_VALUE);

  myShort = myByte;
  // Bytes can be implicitly converted into shorts
  // As shorts store a greater range than bytes
  myByte = (byte) myShort;
  // But shorts have to be explicitly casted into bytes
  // Because there could be a loss of data

  myInt = myByte;
  myInt = myShort;
  // The same applies to ints, with shorts and bytes
  myByte = (byte) myInt;
  myShort = (short) myInt;

  // And to longs, with shorts, bytes and ints
  myLong = myByte;
  myLong = myShort;
  myLong = myInt;

  myByte = (byte) myLong;
  myShort = (short) myLong;
  myInt = (int) myLong;

  // There are also parseLong, parseByte, parseShort methods
  myLong = Long.parseLong("434334432999");
  myShort = Short.parseShort("33455");
  myByte = Byte.parseByte("44");

  System.out.println(myLong);
  System.out.println(myShort);
  System.out.println(myByte);

### Explanation
This exercise introduces you to the three other ways of storing whole numbers, other than integers. Here is a table that gives the data type name and their size in bits.

| Data Type Name | Size           |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| `byte`         | 8 bits         |
| `short`        | 16 bits        |
| `int`          | 32 bits        |
| `long`         | 64 bits        |

Most of the time you will only need to use integers, but longs can be useful if you are doing numerical computations, and shorts and bytes are useful when you have lots of variables. What is important to note is if you converting from a smaller whole number data type to a larger one then, then you don't need explicitly cast the variable, the conversion happens implicitly. But if you are converting from a larger whole number data type to a smaller one, you must put the data type you are converting to in parentheses before what you are actually converting. E.g. if you're converting `k` (which is an int) to a byte you must put `(byte) k`, if you are converting `k + k`, you must put `(byte)(k + k)`, so the computer knows the whole thing is being converted.
