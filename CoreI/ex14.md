```java
public class Ex14 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    char a = 'a'; // Notice single quote mark
    System.out.println(a);
    a++; // You can manipulate characters as if they were ints
    // Actually they are ints
    System.out.println(a);
    a += 5;
    System.out.println(a);

    String hello = "hello";
    char first = hello.charAt(0); // 0 means the first character
    char last = hello.charAt(4); // 4 means the fifth character
    System.out.println("The first letter = " + first + " and the last letter = " + last);

    // Loop
    for(int i = 0; i < hello.length(); i++) {
      System.out.println(hello.charAt(i));
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation
1. Characters are another data type. Unlike strings, which consist of multiple characters, a `char` consists of only one character.
2. They are defined using a quotation mark, as opposed to a speech mark.
3. Since strings use `char` internally, you can get the character at a given position, like you get an item from an array like `arr` at a given position, starting from 0, using the `charAt()` method. So `.charAt(0)` refers to the first character, `.charAt(1)` to the second, and so on.
4. You can also the `.length()` method on strings to loop through each character.
