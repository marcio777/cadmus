```java
public class Ex13 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // A different way of looping
    int i = 1;
    while(i < 11) {
      System.out.println(i);
      i++;
    }

    i = 1;
    while(i % 5 == 0) {
      i++;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```

### Explanation
1. In this exercise, we introduce `while` loops which are another kind of loop. They are like `for` loops but they only have a condition that has to be met, and no initialisation or increment. That is why variables used in the condition are defined beforehand.
2. The first loop loops until `i` equals 11, whereas the second loop loops until `i` is perfectly divisible by 5.
