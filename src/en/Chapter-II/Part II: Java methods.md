Methods
===

Here's an example of a method:

```java
public static void convertToF(int celsius) {
	int fahrenheit = ((celsius * 9) /5) + 32;
	System.out.println("C:" + celsius + " F: " + fahrenheit);
}
```
	
Don’t worry if you don’t quite understand what’s going on in the code above for now. What you are looking at, however, is a basic method which converts a temperature you specify in degrees Celsius to its equivalent in Fahrenheit.  

## Creating and defining your very first method
Before creating your first method, there are a few things you need to know. Mainly, the two ingredients needed to create a method: the method **header** and the method **body**.

To do this, let’s first decipher the method above.

The very first line of the method named `convertToF` is known as the method header.

```java
public void convertToF(int celsius)
```

When we refer to a method body, we basically mean everything within the curly brackets after a method header.

```java
public void convertToF(int celsius) {
	int fahrenheit = celsius * 9/5 + 32;
	System.out.println(" C:" + celsius + " F: " + fahrenheit);
}
```

A method header consists of the following:

Sometimes, we want methods to 'return' something to us, and we specify this in the **return type**. For example, you might want one of your employees to give you a report. In this case, however, you have specified that you don’t want anything. Thus, you have told your employee (this method) to return `void` i.e. nothing. 

NOTE: This can be changed to other return types of your such as `int`, `String`, `boolean`. However, for now, focus on setting methods to return `void`. 

Following the return type is the **method name**, in this case `convertToF`. This is something you specify too. By convention, method names start with a lowercase letter and every other word after starts with a capital. Try to make method names reasonably short and meaningful as to what task they carry out, as this will make it easier in the long run.

Following the method name comes the **parameter list** (the contents of the brackets). This enables you to pass values into a method. For example, in the `convertToF` method, it accepts one parameter (`celsius`) which is declared to be of type int. This means that when using this method later on, you can input something like `convertToF(20)` in order to convert 20 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit.

For now, you are going to have to accept that there is something called an **access modifier** that will be at the start of every method you write. In this case, we will always be using the access modifier `public`. For the curious, access modifiers are related to classes (a key feature of an object-orientated language like Java), and other 'access modifiers', apart from public, exist, such as `private` and `protected`. It is also not actually a requirement to have an access modifier at the beginning of a method. 

## Static methods
Hitherto you've only met static methods, which are methods that belong to a class, as opposed to an instance of a class. For instance, the method `Integer.parseInt()` (which is in the next part) is a static method. If I, however, create an integer like so:

```java
Integer age = 5;
```

`age` does not have the method `.parseInt()`. What I'm trying to say is that when you meet many of these methods the bit after the full stop is a static method. Similarly, the methods you've created and will create with the `static` keyword are also static methods. If you were to remove the `static` keyword from them they would not be able to be called by the `main` method.

N.B.: `Math.abs()`, and `Math.sqrt()` are also statics, as are other methods inside the `Math` package, such as trigonometric functions `Math.sin()`, `Math.cos()`, and `Math.tan()`.

## Calling methods
To call the method from the `main` method or any other non-static method, write:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	int converted = convertToF(10);
	System.out.println(converted);
}
```

### Ex 1
Write a method called `pizzazz` which accepts one integer and displays `Pizzazz` on the terminal if the integer is fully divisible by 7. If the integer isn’t divisible by 7, display `A tragic number has been entered` instead.

### Ex 2
Write a method called `checkEvenOdd` which accepts one integer and checks if it is odd or even. If the integer is odd, `The number is odd` will be displayed on the terminal. 

### Ex 3
Write a method called `findTriangleArea` which accepts two parameters, the base length and height of a triangle, then calculates and displays the area of the triangle.
Hint: As if you didn't know - the area of a triangle = 0.5 * base * height

### Ex 4
Write a method called `findParaArea` which accepts two parameters, the base length and height of a parallelogram, then calculates and displays its area on screen.
Hint: the area of a parallelogram = base * height 

### Ex 5
Copy & paste the method for Ex 3 and rename it `findTrapeArea`. The method should now calculate the area of a given trapezium. What changes should you make?
Hint: the area of a trapezium (top length + bottom length)/2 * height

## Non-static methods
To define a non-static method, you have to - bet you can't guess - remove the `static` keyword. You can call non-static methods inside the main method like so:

i) First, instantiate the class (for example if the class were called `Task`):

```java
Task myNewObject = new Task();
```

ii) Then, call the method on the object like so (if the method was called `methodName`):

```java
myNewObject.methodName();
```

Note that in order to call a method on an object, all you really need to do is put a dot after the object name, followed by the method name and parameter list. 

### Ex 1
Write a non-static method called triple (and the main method of course), which triples a number.  Get the program to triple the number 34 and then print out the result.

### Ex 2
Write a non-static method, which returns a "Hello World"-style greeting. For instance, if I called it with `George`, it would respond with: `Hello George!`.
