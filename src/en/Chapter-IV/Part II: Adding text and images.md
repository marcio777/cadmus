HelloWorld
===

In the last part, we created an empty window; now we want to add some text to it. We will create a class that extends the JFrame from HelloWorld just like last time, but this time our class will have a property called `label` that will be an instance of the class `JLabel`. We will also use an instance of the `FlowLayout` class to organise the elements on screen. The following imports will be needed:

```java
import java.awt.FlowLayout;
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JLabel;
```

Here is the code, copy it and we'll discuss it later:

```java
public class HelloWorld extends JFrame {
    JLabel label = new JLabel("Hello World", JLabel.CENTER);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new HelloWorld();
    }

    public HelloWorld() {
        add(label);

        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
	    setSize(300, 70);
	    setTitle("Hello World");
	    setVisible(true);
	    setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
	}
}
```

Notice the constructor for the `JLabel`: it takes in two parameters, both of which are optional. The first is its text, the second is its alignment. We then use the `add()` method to add it to the window. Also notice how the `setLayout()` method is used to set the **layout manager** to a new instance of a `FlowLayout`. We will explore FlowLayout in a later part.

This should be outputted:

### Ex 1
Play around with it. Try adding another `JLabel` with a different greeting. You may have to change the second parameter, the height parameter, of `setSize()` to fit it in. You will have to add another call to the `add()` method.

## Customising text
As you have probably noticed, with the code you currently know there is no way to change the size or font of the text on a JLabel. This does not mean that it is not possible. It is done using `Font`, and is done as follows:

```java
label.setFont(new Font("Serif", Font.PLAIN, 45));
```

There are a few things to be defined here. `label` is the identifier of a JLabel that I had delared and instantiated above. Then you have the `new Font`, which has 3 parameters. The first of which is the font type. I have used "Serif" here, but you could just as easily use something like "Times New Roman". The second is the format of the font. What I mean by that is that this includes things like italics, bold, plain etc. A full list can be found if you were to use this once you write the `.` after `Font`. The third and final one is possibly the most important, as it sets the size of the text. I have set mine to 45. Using the above code, and a bit more, I have created the following:

## Adding Pictures to JLabels
It may not say it outright, but this part is desgined to show you how to create something and add it to a JFrame, in particular, JLabels. But these JLabels are far more useful than just displaying a line of text. They can be changed on the push of a button, can be attached to almost anything and can display images, which is what this is about.

To set a JLabel (or a button, but you'll see that later) to contain an image, first you have to import the image into Eclipse. To do this, find an image and save it to your computer. Then, in Eclipse, click **File** in the top bar, and then click **Import**. This should give you the following screen:

![Importing images](../../Images/Chapter-IV/HelloWorld/imports.png)

Then choose your file source, which will most likely be General->File System. This will then give you this:

![Choosing your image](../../Images/Chapter-IV/HelloWorld/imports2.png)

I have already filled this in. I have taken my pictures from the Sample Pictures folder, which I got when I clicked the Browse button (bordered in black) and followed the path Libraries->Pictures->Public Pictures->Sample Pictures. However you could store your images anywhere and find them. I then chose the folder to import them to using the **Browse** button (bordered in blue) and chose the folder JavaKS4, which is simply one of my folders.

That will import your images and make them easy to access. Now, back to the point. To create an image you will need to import `javax.swing.ImageIcon` and use code similar to this:

```java
public class ImagesExample extends JFrame {
	ImageIcon image;
	JLabel label;
	//declares an ImageIcon(which the image is defined as) and a JLabel.
	
	public imagesExample() {
		image = new ImageIcon("Tulips.jpg"); // sets the ImageIcon to be Tulips.jpg
		label = new JLabel(image); // set the JLabel to be the image.
		
		add(label);

		setSize(1024, 800);
		setVisible(true);
		setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		setTitle("An Image");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new ImagesExample();
	}
}
```

This should output the following, only it would be the size of the screen:

![Tulips image](../../Images/Chapter-IV/HelloWorld/Tulips.png)

### Ex 2
Try it yourself. Also research the `getIconWidth()` and `getIconHeight()` of `ImageIcon` and try them out too.

## Scrollable Images
I just mentioned that the image will be the size of the screen, but what if the image is larger? In that case you would lose some of the image. For this reason it would be useful to have scroll bars so you could see all of the image. To do this you need to import `javax.swing.JScrollPane`. These scroll panes are very useful, as now your images can be infinite in size. To use these you will have to declare a new scroll pane first:

```java
JScrollPane scroller = new JScrollPane();
```

Then adding this to the constructor:

```java
scroller = new JScrollPane(label);
//where 'scroller' is the name of the JScrollPane and 'label' is the name of the JLabel with an image on it

scroller.setVerticalScrollBarPolicy(JScrollPane.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_ALWAYS);
//sets the vertical scroll bar to always be showing, regardless whether or not it is in use

scroller.setHorizontalScrollBarPolicy(JScrollPane.HORIZONTAL_SCROLLBAR_ALWAYS);
//sets the horizontal bar in the same way as the vertical bar 

add(scroller);
//adds the scroller and therefore the image too
```

You have just added the image to the scroll pane and added the scroll pane to the JFrame. This means that now, however big the image is, you can see it. You can also, if you so wish, shorten the first three lines to: 

```java
scroller.setViewportView(image);
```

However this gives a lot less control over the scroll bars, for example without it you can set the bars to be on the image as needed, all the time or not at all. You can therefore create an image like this:

![A scrollable image](../../Images/Chapter-IV/HelloWorld/scroll-images.png)

### Ex 3
Import more images and put the on JLabels. If the image is very big, add scroll bars to it. Also, explore the different scroll bar policies i.e. `VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_ALWAYS`, `VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_AS_NEEDED` and `VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_NEVER`.
